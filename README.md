# Coexistence of UAVs and Terrestrial Users in Millimeter-Wave Urban Networks
5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular networks are in the early phase of commercial deployments and present a unique opportunity for robust, high-data-rate communication to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A fundamental question is whether and how mmWave networks designed for terrestrial users should be modified to serve UAVs. The paper invokes realistic cell layouts, antenna patterns, and channel models trained from extensive ray tracing data to assess the performance of various network alternatives. Importantly, the study considers the addition of dedicated uptilted rooftop-mounted cells for aerial coverage, as well as novel spectrum sharing modes between terrestrial and aerial network operators. The effect of power control and of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output are also studied.
